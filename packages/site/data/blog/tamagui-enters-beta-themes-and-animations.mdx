Tamagui enters beta!

Six months, hundreds of bugs, 3 demo apps, 1 benchmark suite, and 2 big new features: **themes v2** and **pluggable animations**. Here's what's new:

### Start faster with create-tamagui-app

Set up a starter repo with expo, webpack, and tamagui configured and ready to go:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest my-app
```

### Themes v2

Themes has been redone to add a ton of flexiblity and power. Tamagui now supports unlimited sub-themes, and per-component theming. Further, we've standardized the names of theme props, giving full control to customize any aspect of every component.

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollbars={false}>
  <XStack py="$4">
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    </YStack>
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue" />
    </YStack>
  </XStack>
</ScrollView>

We've also fixed and improved a lot of how the `@tamagui/feather-icons`, the `Button` component, and the theme engine all work together to automatically handle passing values between each other.

[Read the docs for more on how](/docs/intro/themes).

### Animations

Animations are making their way into `@tamagui/core`. While they should be considered somewhat experimental as we get feedback and use them more in practice, we think the API's won't change signifcantly.

### Better styled() helper

The styled helper now automatically detects Text/View components and properly handles their styling/types. It also detects Inputs and a wider range of react-native components for automatic styling.

### New Components

Over the last few months we've added:

- [Inputs](/docs/components/forms)
- [Image](/docs/components/image)
- [Separator](/docs/components/separator)
- [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse) and [ThemeReset](/docs/core/theme#theme-reset)
- [Popover](/docs/components/popover) and [HoverablePopover](/docs/components/hoverable-popover)
- [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip)
- [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer)
- [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes)
- [HTML Elements](/docs/components/html-elements)

These are big, helpful components and we've made sure each works fully with the optimizing compiler and full suite of react-native and Tamagui properties.

But this is also just the start. There's tons of room to grow and improve. We're looking at using [Floating UI]() to improve the various floating panels. We'll continue to add form components that can share fully consistent styles. And much more.

### Focus styling

We landed experimental support for the `focusStyle` prop, which works much like `pressStyle` and `hoverStyle`.

### ThemeReset

Sometimes you want to have your theme reset to the one above it. ThemeReset does just this. Note: it's not SSR compatible if you're doing automatic light/dark themes - it will still work, but there may be a flash on first load. There's a fix for this that is a bit involved,so we think it's still useful to release as experimental until we land that.

### Renaming space to gap

As we're moving from alpha to beta, we're going to take this chance to make breaking changes. To better align with the flexbox spec, `space` has been renamed to `gap`.
